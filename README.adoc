== JedisCache
An implementation of JCache which uses Jedis to implement the Cache commands.

For release/deployment instructions, refer to https://github.com/mizool/mizool/[Mizool].

== Limitations
* Listener support is not implemented.
* The following JCache operations were implemented using multiple subsequent commands to Redis, which creates race conditions:
** getAndPut
** putAll
** remove(K,V)
** getAndRemove
** replace(K,V)
** replace(K,V,V)
** getAndReplace
** removeAll(Set)
** removeAll
